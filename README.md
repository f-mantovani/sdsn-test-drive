[![Cypress](https://github.com/f-mantovani/sdsn-test-drive/actions/workflows/cypress.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/f-mantovani/sdsn-test-drive/actions/workflows/cypress.yml)

## How to run

### Using pnpm

#### Option 1

You already have it installed:

1. Run the script for build and start

```shell
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

or

1. Run the script to check the development evironment

```shell
pnpm dev
```

2. Access the [http://localhost:3000](localhost)

#### Option 2

You don't have pnpm installed, but want to check it out:

1. Execute the command to let node install pnpm, other methods of [installation](https://pnpm.io/installation)

```shell
corepack enable pnpm
```

2. Run the script for build and start

```shell
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

or

2. Run the script to check the development evironment

```shell
pnpm dev
```

3. Access the [http://localhost:3000](localhost)

### Using other package manager

1. Possible the best would be to delete the lock file and install the dependencies with your prefered method

```shell
 rm pnpm-lock.yaml

 npm install
 # or
 yarn install
```

2. Run the script for build and start

```shell
npm run build && npm start
# or
yarn build && yarn start
```

or

2. Run the script to check the development evironment

```shell
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

3. Access the [http://localhost:3000](localhost)

### Challenges

#### Problems

1. The majority of my NextJs base was with the App Router
2. Using JQuery inside of Cypress
3. Some styling blockage
4. Understanding how the data came from the API
5. Creating a legend for the colors and arrows

#### Solutions

1. Reading the documentation and trial and error
2. A quickly search on Google solved the problem in that case followed with some trial and error to get the css property followed by another research
3. Expand the page to take the full screen on desktop `html, body, #__next`
4. The data was a matter of analysis how the data came back and experiment a little bit
5. The colors and arrows I needed to look upon the Development report and after I found also a ranking website that I could discover each one of the specific meanings
